# test-delivery

the first thing to do is:

- clone the project with the command: git clone `https://gitlab.com/marz900/demo_app.git`
- open project in vscode, then we point to the directory of the project at the root:
    if you already open the project with vscode, it may already point to the root of the project
    but first make sure terminal is open in vscode if not open terminal in vscode

- afterwards you always point to the root of the project and run the suite command to install the dependencies: `yarn install`
- after installing the dependencies you run the following command to start the server: `yarn start`
- then, in another terminal still pointing to the root of the project, type the following command to install the application on your device: `npx react-native run-android`
